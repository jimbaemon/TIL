## What is Scrum

* Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 
* encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.



## Sprints

> A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work.**

* “With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces," - Megan Cook
* In order to plan your upcoming sprint, you use the sprint planning meeting
* Sprint planning based on two question,
  * What work can get done in this sprint
  * How will the chosen work get done?

### DO AND Do Not

#### **DO**

* Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and **how success will be measured.**
* Do ensure **you have a well-groomed backlog** with your priorities and dependencies in order.
* Ensure you have a good **understanding of velocity**
* Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to **flesh out intimate details of the work** that needs to get done.
  * Encourage team members to **sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks** that come into the sprint.
* **Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done,**
* Finally, once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool

#### DO Not

* **Don’t pull in too many stories**, overestimate velocity
* Don’t forget about **quality or technical debt.**
* Don’t let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint.  Nail it down, and don’t focus so much on moving *fast* that you forget to make sure everyone’s moving in *the same direction*.
* Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work.
  * Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.
* If you hear concerns from the team, whether it’s about velocity, low-certainty work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, **don’t ignore it.**
