## What is Scrum

* Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 
* encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.



## Sprints

> A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to **complete a set amount of work.**

* “With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces," - Megan Cook
* In order to plan your upcoming sprint, you use the sprint planning meeting
* Sprint planning based on two question,
  * What work can get done in this sprint
  * How will the chosen work get done?

### Do AND Do Not

#### **Do**

* Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and **how success will be measured.**
* Do ensure **you have a well-groomed backlog** with your priorities and dependencies in order.
* Ensure you have a good **understanding of velocity**
* Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to **flesh out intimate details of the work** that needs to get done.
  * Encourage team members to **sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks** that come into the sprint.
* **Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done,**
* Finally, once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool

#### Do Not

* **Don’t pull in too many stories**, overestimate velocity
* Don’t forget about **quality or technical debt.**
* Don’t let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint.  Nail it down, and don’t focus so much on moving *fast* that you forget to make sure everyone’s moving in *the same direction*.
* Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work.
  * Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.
* **If you hear concerns from the team**, whether it’s about velocity, low-certainty work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, **don’t ignore it.**



## Spring Planning

> Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.

* You need to decide on **how long the time** box is going to be, the sprint goal, and **where** you're going to **start.**
* The sprint planning session kicks off the sprint by **setting the agenda and focus.**
* Bad sprint plans can derail the team by setting **unrealistic expectations.**

### The What

* The **product owner describes** the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal. 
* The **scrum team decides** what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint

### The How

* The **development team plans the work necessary** to deliver the sprint goal.
* sprint plan is a **negotiation** between the development team and product owner

### The Who

*  You cannot do sprint planning without the **product owner** or the **development team.** 
* The **product owner defines the goal** based on the value that they seek.
* The **development team** needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal.

### The Inputs

* A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog as it provides a list of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current sprint.
* The team should also look at the existing work done in the increment and have a view to capacity.

### The Outputs

* The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the **team can describe the goal of the sprint** and how they will start working toward that goal. 

### Sprint planning Preperation

* The product owner must be prepared, combining the lessons from the previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback, and their vision for the product, so they set the scene for the sprint.
* the [product backlog](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/backlogs)should be up-to-date and refined to provide clarity.
* However, for most teams, it’s better to get the **team together to review and refine the backlog** prior to sprint planning.

### Spring planning time limiting

* Sprint planning should be constrained no more than two hours for each week of the sprint.
* A timebox is a maximum time allowed; there is no minimum time allowed.

### Focus on the outcomes not the work

* Scrum is an empirical process, meaning that you can’t plan upfront, but rather [learn by doing](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays?attributes=customer-centricity), and then feed that information back into the process

* User stories, written like the one below, re-focus defects, issues, and improvements on the outcome the customer is seeking rather than the observed problem.

  ```
  As <type of user>, I want <a goal> so that <a reason>
  ```

* By adding clear, measurable results to the user story, the outcomes can be clearly measured, and you know when you are done. 

### Don’t pretend you know more than you do

* The team needs to define what can or cannot be done in the sprint:  estimated effort vs capacity.
* Good estimation requires a **trust-based environment where information is given freely,** and assumptions are discussed in the pursuit of learning and improvement,



## Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning

**Attendees:**

* Development Team
* Scrum Master
* Product Owner

**When:** At the beginning of a sprint.

**Duration:** a Hour per week

**Purpose:** 

* the product owner will have a prioritized product backlog.
* The development team will then make a sprint forecast outlining how much work the team can complete from the product backlog.

### Daily Stand-up

**Attendees:**

* Development Team
* Scrum Master
* Product Owner

**When:** Once per day

**Duration:** No more than 15 minutes.

**Purpose:**  quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team.

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Am I blocked by anything?

### Iteration Review

**Attendees:**

**Required:** 

* development team
* scrum master

* product owner

**Optional:** 

* project stakeholders

**When:** At the end of a sprint or milestone.

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes.

**Purpose:** showcase the work of the team.

* Time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments
* Get immediate feedback from project stakeholders.

### Retrospective

**Attendees:**

**Duration:** 60 minutes.

**Purpose:** help the team understand what worked well–and what didn't.
